OSI Model: The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven abstraction layers. It provides a systematic way to understand and design network protocols and communication processes. The model consists of seven layers, from the lowest to the highest: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.
