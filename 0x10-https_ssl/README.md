0x10. HTTPS SSL

HTTPS and SSL's Two Main Roles:

HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, and SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer. HTTPS is essentially the secure version of HTTP, the protocol used for transmitting data over the internet. SSL is the technology that encrypts the data being transmitted.

The two main roles of HTTPS and SSL are:

a. Encryption: SSL ensures that data transferred between a user's web browser and a website's server is encrypted. This encryption scrambles the data in such a way that only authorized parties can access and understand it. This protects sensitive information such as login credentials, personal details, and financial transactions from being intercepted and read by hackers or malicious actors.

b. Authentication: SSL also provides authentication, which means it verifies the identity of the website the user is connecting to. This helps users trust that they are communicating with the legitimate website they intended to visit and not a fraudulent or malicious one. SSL achieves this through digital certificates issued by trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs) that confirm the identity of the website.
